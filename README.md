## Dependencies
node.js and npm
Install by running:

`sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
Install all dependencies by running:

`npm install`

Additional Info:

For now, nodemon needs to be installed globally. Since nodemon.json only works (at least as far as I can tell) when it's installed globally.

## Running
Simply run npm start
